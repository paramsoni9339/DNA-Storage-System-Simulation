# DNA-Storage-System-Simulation
Create a program that simulates DNA as a medium for data storage, as mentioned in your case study. Explore encoding and decoding data into DNA sequences.  it will help to convert big data sets into a biological way of storing data that will help store super big data sets into less space occupying storage
